# Description
The Culture Exchange Website was a Group Project consisting of 4 members including myself. The objective of this program is to bring all different cultures from around the world together and familiarize oursleves with the heritages of those around us.

The Culture Exchange website  is a forum and networking application where a user will start off by creating a profile with name, general location, profile pic and, if desired, what country they are representing. Once a user is created the person can view network with other individuals to learn more about the different cultures around them. This can be done through messaging, reading local stories and attending other user created events that might be in their area. Theses events can be anything ranging from food and dance to fitness and political events, all designed to represent and celebrate the different cultures from around the world.
